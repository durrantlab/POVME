							   # imagine, identifying just the right set

							   # boxes to encompass the binding pocket
							   # is challenging. One approach is to
							   # define an initial geometry, visualize

							   # using a program like VMD, and then
							   # iteratively add new inclusion and
							   # exclusion regions as required. The

							   # POVME runs, using a saved copy of the

							   # that POVME also saves a NPY file, which
							   # contains the same data as the PDB file
							   # but can be loaded much faster in 
							   # subsequent POVME runs. The point-field
